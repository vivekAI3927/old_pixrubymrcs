Thank you for joining Pass The MRCS. We found that the most effective revision process was to:
 
1) Read the question
2) Say your answer out-loud prior to reviewing the model answer (even more effective is to record yourselves and write the answer out)
3) Review how many marks your answer would get (and review your recording etc. to pinpoint areas of improvement in tone of voice, articulation, structure/content, body language etc.)
 
We want you to pass first time, so recommend you become the toughest self-examiner when practicing and revisit topics multiple times.

The knowledge heavy topics, anatomy, physiology/critical care, and pathology are probably best tackled first as there is a lot to learn. Closer to the exam remember to practice the stations with friends, especially history taking, communication and examination – use the mark schemes and key information to guide you.  

If you find the site useful please tell your friends about it – we rely on word of mouth recommendations. If you're interested in becoming an official rep for the site, please let us know via email.

Good luck.
